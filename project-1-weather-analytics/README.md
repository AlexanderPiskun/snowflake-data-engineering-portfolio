## 🧱 Architecture and Design Overview

### 🔗 Data Lineage with Snowsight

End-to-end data lineage is automatically captured and visualized using Snowsight.

#### Lineage flows across:

```
SNOWFLAKE_PUBLIC_DATA_FREE (Marketplace Share)
              ↓
          RAW (Local Transient Tables - Low-cost data landing bufeer)
              ↓
        STAGING (Cleaned & Typed)
              ↓
      DATA_MART (Facts & Dims & Analytics)
	          ↓
      ANALYTICS (Secure, RLS-enabled views)
	          ↓
      Consumers (Roles)
```

#### Snowsight enables:

- Column-level lineage tracking
- Impact analysis for schema changes
- Upstream/downstream dependency visibility

This provides strong operational confidence and aligns with Snowflake Horizon’s trust & observability goals.

### Why This Architecture?
- Clear separation of concerns
- Supports incremental processing
- RBAC‑safe and task‑friendly
- Mirrors real enterprise Snowflake deployments

## 📂 Data Sources (Snowflake Marketplace)

The pipeline is built on **free NOAA datasets** available via the Snowflake Marketplace:

- `NOAA_WEATHER_METRICS_TIMESERIES`
- `NOAA_WEATHER_STATION_INDEX`
- `NOAA_NWRFC_WATER_SUPPLY_TIMESERIES`

These datasets are exposed via the **`SNOWFLAKE_PUBLIC_DATA_FREE` share** under the `PUBLIC_DATA_FREE` schema.

---

## ⚠️ Important Design Decision: RAW Layer Uses TABLES (Not Views)

### ❓ Why not create RAW views over Marketplace objects?

Initially, the RAW layer was designed using **views** that directly referenced Marketplace objects, for example:

```sql
CREATE VIEW RAW.NOAA_WEATHER_METRICS_TS AS
SELECT *
FROM SNOWFLAKE_PUBLIC_DATA_FREE.PUBLIC_DATA_FREE.NOAA_WEATHER_METRICS_TIMESERIES;
```

However, this approach **breaks task execution** under a non‑admin role.

---

### 🚨 The Core Issue: Imported Privileges

- Marketplace databases are **imported from a data share**
- Privileges on shared databases are controlled **only by the data provider**
- Consumer accounts **cannot grant `USAGE` or `IMPORTED PRIVILEGES`** unless explicitly allowed
- In this case, the provider **did not expose imported privileges**

As a result:
- Interactive `SELECT` queries worked
- **Snowflake TASK execution failed**, even when:
  - Task owner was correct
  - Schema and warehouse privileges were granted

Snowflake tasks execute **server‑side** and require **direct access to all underlying objects**, not just the top‑level view.

---

### ✅ Solution: Materialize RAW Layer as Local Transient Tables (acts as a low-cost buffer to safe on Fail Safe costs)

To ensure reliable, RBAC‑safe execution, the RAW layer was redesigned to use **local transinet tables** populated from Marketplace data:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRANSIENT TABLE RAW.NOAA_WEATHER_METRICS_TS AS
SELECT *
FROM SNOWFLAKE_PUBLIC_DATA_FREE.PUBLIC_DATA_FREE.NOAA_WEATHER_METRICS_TIMESERIES;
```

#### Benefits of This Approach
- ✅ Tasks execute successfully under `NOAA_ENGINEER` role
- ✅ No dependency on imported privileges
- ✅ Full ownership and RBAC control
- ✅ Better isolation from Marketplace changes
- ✅ More realistic enterprise pattern

> This mirrors real‑world Snowflake deployments, where external or shared data is **snapshotted into internal RAW tables** before further processing.

## 🗂️ Data Layers Explained

### 🟦 RAW Layer
**Purpose:** Snapshot ingestion from Marketplace

- Local tables created via `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT`
- Represents source‑aligned data
- Reloaded periodically (snapshot pattern)

Key objects:
- `RAW.NOAA_WEATHER_METRICS_TS`
- `RAW.NOAA_WEATHER_STATION_INDEX`
- `RAW.NOAA_WATER_SUPPLY_TS`

---

### 🟨 STAGING Layer
**Purpose:** Data cleansing and standardization

- Explicit data conversion (casting)
- Column renaming
- Load timestamps

Example:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW STAGING.V_STG_WEATHER_METRICS AS
SELECT
  station_id,
  metric_name,
  observation_date::DATE AS observation_date,
  metric_value::FLOAT AS metric_value,
  CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AS load_ts
FROM RAW.NOAA_WEATHER_METRICS_TS;
```

---

### 🟩 DATA_MART Layer
**Purpose:** Aggregated fact and dim tables

- Incremental processing using **STREAMS + TASKS**
- Aggregated facts and dims


#### Key objects:
- `DATA_MART.FACT_WEATHER_INPUT`
- `DATA_MART.FACT_WEATHER_DAILY`
- `DATA_MART.DIM_STATION`

---
### 🟩 ANALYTICS Layer
**Purpose:** Analytics Layer (Consumption Layer) with Row-Level Security (RLS)
The `ANALYTICS` schema represents the `semantic / consumption layer` of the platform. 
It exposes **read-only views** built on top of curated DATA_MART tables and is designed for:

- BI tools (Power BI, Tableau, Looker, etc.)
- Data analysts and business users
- External consumers with limited privileges

This layer intentionally contains **no physical tables** — only views and security policies.

#### Key objects:
- `ANALYTICS.AVG_TEMP_BY_STATE`
- `ANALYTICS.TEMP_VARIABILITY`
- `ANALYTICS.EXTREME_TEMP_DAYS`
- `ANALYTICS.TOP_10_WARMEST_STATIONS`

---


## 🔄 Orchestration & Incremental Processing

### Tasks
- Snapshot loads for RAW and STAGING
- Incremental fact building using streams

### Tasks flow:
```
TASK_LOAD_STAGING_WEATHER (root task)
    ↓ (overwrite)
 TASK_LOAD_FACT_INPUT (child task, executed after TASK_LOAD_STAGING_WEATHER)
    ↓ (overwrite)
 STREAM detects changes 
    ↓
 TASK_BUILD_FACT_WEATHER_DAILY (child task, executed after TASK_LOAD_FACT_INPUT)
    (runs ONLY if stream has data)
```

### Streams
- Track changes after snapshot reloads
- Enable efficient downstream processing

Example guard:
```sql
WHEN SYSTEM$STREAM_HAS_DATA('FACT_WEATHER_INPUT_STREAM')
```

#### This ensures:
- No unnecessary warehouse usage
- Exactly‑once processing semantics

## 🔐 RBAC Model

| Role                    | Responsibilities                                                                |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ACCOUNTADMIN`          | Marketplace setup, warehouse, database and roles creation                       |
| `NOAA_ENGINEER`         | Owns tables, views, streams, tasks                                              |
| `NOAA_ANALYST`          | Read-only access to ANALYTICS schema                                            |
| `NOAA_ANALYST_WEST`     | Read-only access to ANALYTICS schema + allowed to see WEST states only (RLS)    |
| `NOAA_ANALYST_CENTRAL`  | Read-only access to ANALYTICS schema + allowed to see CENTRAL states only (RLS) |
| `NOAA_ANALYST_EAST`     | Read-only access to ANALYTICS schema + allowed to see EAST states only (RLS)    |


The project strictly follows **least-privilege principles** and enforces a **clear separation between physical data models and business consumption**.

## 🔐 Governance, Security & Data Observability

### 🌐 Horizon Catalog Integration
This project is designed to align with Snowflake Horizon Catalog best practices, enabling data discoverability, trust, and governance across the entire analytics lifecycle.

#### Key Capabilities

- Object-level metadata (databases, schemas, tables, views)
- Column-level data quality metrics
- Tag-based classification (PII, data domain)
- Built-in lineage visualization via Snowsight

All layers `(RAW, STAGING, DATA_MART, ANALYTICS)` are structured to be catalog-friendly, allowing Snowflake Horizon to surface lineage, ownership, freshness, and quality signals.

### 📊 Data Quality Monitoring with Data Metric Functions (DMFs)

The project implements Snowflake-native Data Quality Monitoring using Data Metric Functions (DMFs) instead of custom SQL-only checks.

**MONITORING Schema**
`MONITORING`
 ├── `DATA_QUALITY_RESULTS`          -- Custom quality results table
 ├── `TASK_DQ_FACT_WEATHER`          -- Legacy SQL-based DQ task
 └── `DMF-based monitoring`          -- Snowflake-managed quality metrics

### 📊DMF-Based Quality Checks

DMFs are associated directly with critical analytical tables such as:

**DATA_MART.FACT_WEATHER_DAILY** and **DATA_MART.DIM_STATION**

#### Examples of implemented quality dimensions:

- Completeness (NULL_COUNT on critical metrics)
- Validity (BLANK_COUNT on dimension attributes)
- Uniqueness (DUPLICATE_COUNT on natural keys)
- Volume (ROW_COUNT trends)

DMFs are scheduled using **DATA_METRIC_SCHEDULE**, and results are automatically stored in Snowflake’s internal quality event store and surfaced in Snowsight → Catalog → Data Quality.

#### This approach provides:

- Centralized, queryable quality metrics
- UI-driven monitoring and trend analysis
- Seamless Horizon Catalog integration


### 🏷 Object Tagging & Tag-Based Data Masking
The project uses Snowflake Object Tags as first-class governance primitives.

**SECURITY Schema**

All security-related objects are isolated in a dedicated schema:

`SECURITY`
 ├── `PII_CLASS`                -- Column-level PII classification tag
 ├── `DATA_DOMAIN`              -- Table-level data domain tag
 ├── `MASKING POLICIES`         -- Tag-driven masking rules
 └── `ROW ACCESS POLICIES`      -- Regional access control

#### PII Classification (PII_CLASS)

Columns containing sensitive data are tagged with:

  `LOW`
  `HIGH`

Masking behavior is automatically enforced using tag-based masking policies, without modifying queries or views.

#### Benefits:

- Centralized PII control
- Policy reuse across schemas
- Separation of security logic from data logic

#### Data Domain Classification (DATA_DOMAIN)

Entire tables are tagged using:
```sql
ALTER TABLE <table> SET TAG SECURITY.DATA_DOMAIN = 'WEATHER_ANALYTICS';
```

#### This enables:

- Logical grouping of datasets
- Domain-based governance
- Easier discovery and auditability in Horizon Catalog

### 🔐 Security & Governance Model

The project follows **enterprise-grade Snowflake governance principles**:

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

`NOAA_ENGINEER`  – pipeline development & operations
`NOAA_ANALYST_*` – analytics access (region-based)
`ACCOUNTADMIN`   – security and infrastructure

### Row-Level Security (RLS)

Row Access Policies restrict data access by `U.S. region (WEST / CENTRAL / EAST)` based on analyst role membership.

#### This ensures:

- Least-privilege access
- No data duplication
- Secure multi-tenant analytics

### Tag-Based Masking + RLS Combined

The project demonstrates how:

- RLS controls “which rows you see”
- Masking controls “what values you see”

Both are enforced transparently at query time.


A dedicated schema is used for data observability artifacts:

## 🧭 Formal Design Decision: ANALYTICS Schema as the Consumption Layer

### Decision
Create a dedicated **`ANALYTICS` schema** containing business-facing views built on top of `DATA_MART`, and grant read-only access to analytics users **only** on this schema.

### Rationale
- Decouples consumers from physical fact/dimension tables
- Enables safe refactoring of `DATA_MART`
- Simplifies RBAC and auditing
- Centralizes governance logic (RLS, masking, semantic naming)
- Mirrors enterprise data platform best practices

### Consequences
- Analysts interact only with curated, stable views
- Engineering retains full control over data modeling
- Security policies can evolve without breaking dashboards

This schema acts as the **data contract** between data engineering and analytics.

---

## 🔒 Row-Level Security (RLS) Examples

Row-level security is implemented using Snowflake Row Access Policies applied to ANALYTICS views.
Access decisions are evaluated dynamically based on the current role and a centralized role-to-state mapping table.
This design enforces least privilege while preserving a single reusable DATA_MART layer.


### Example : State-Based Access Control

#### Mapping Table
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE SECURITY.STATE_ACCESS_MAP (
  role_name STRING,
  state STRING
);
```

```sql
INSERT INTO SECURITY.STATE_ACCESS_MAP VALUES
  ('NOAA_ANALYST_WEST', 'California'),
  ('NOAA_ANALYST_WEST', 'Washington'),
  ('NOAA_ANALYST_CENTRAL', 'Arkansas'),
  ('NOAA_ANALYST_CENTRAL', 'Illinois'),
  ('NOAA_ANALYST_EAST', 'Alabama'),
  ('NOAA_ANALYST_EAST', 'Connecticut'),
  .
  .
  .
```

#### Row Access Policy
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE ROW ACCESS POLICY SECURITY.STATE_RLP
AS (p_state STRING) RETURNS BOOLEAN ->
     'NOAA_ANALYST' = CURRENT_ROLE() 
  OR 'NOAA_ENGINEER' = CURRENT_ROLE()
  OR EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM SECURITY.STATE_ACCESS_MAP
      WHERE role_name = CURRENT_ROLE()
        AND state = p_state
    );
```

#### Apply Policy to ANALYTICS View
```sql
ALTER VIEW ANALYTICS.V_AVG_TEMP_BY_STATE
ADD ROW ACCESS POLICY SECURITY.STATE_RLP ON (state);
```

---

### Why RLS Is Applied at the ANALYTICS Layer

- Avoids contaminating core fact tables
- Keeps DATA_MART reusable for multiple consumers
- Allows different security rules per use case
- Matches Snowflake governance best practices

### Key Takeaway
> Security policies belong at the **presentation boundary**, not in the physical storage layer.
  This design ensures scalability, governance, and long-term maintainability of the Snowflake platform.

## 🏁 Final Notes

This project intentionally prioritizes **correct, production-grade Snowflake engineering patterns** over convenience or shortcuts.

### Why RAW Tables Instead of Views or Dynamic Tables?

The NOAA datasets are consumed from the Snowflake Marketplace via the `SNOWFLAKE_PUBLIC_DATA_FREE` share. 
While Snowflake offers powerful abstractions such as **views** and **dynamic tables**, neither is suitable in this specific scenario for task-driven pipelines under strict RBAC:

#### 1️ Shared Marketplace Objects & Imported Privileges
- Marketplace databases are **shared** and governed by the data provider
- The consumer account cannot grant `USAGE` or `IMPORTED PRIVILEGES` unless explicitly exposed by the provider
- In this case, imported privileges were **not available**
- As a result, Snowflake **TASKS cannot reliably execute** when sourcing data directly from shared objects (even via local views)

Materializing the data into local RAW tables ensures:
- Full ownership and privilege control
- Reliable server-side task execution
- Isolation from cross-account privilege constraints

#### 2️ Why Not Dynamic Tables?

Dynamic tables require **CHANGE_TRACKING = TRUE** on all upstream source objects.

- The shared Marketplace views **do not have change tracking enabled**
- Change tracking **cannot be enabled by the consumer** on shared objects
- Therefore, dynamic tables **cannot be used** with these datasets

This makes dynamic tables unsuitable for this project despite their advantages in other scenarios.

#### 3️ Final Architectural Choice

Given these constraints, the RAW layer was intentionally designed using:

- `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` (snapshot ingestion)
- Periodic reloads aligned with Marketplace data refresh cadence
- Downstream incremental processing using **STREAMS + TASKS** on locally owned tables

This approach is:
- ✅ Production-grade governance
- ✅ Native Snowflake observability
- ✅ RBAC-safe
- ✅ Security-by-design architecture
- ✅ Task-compatible
- ✅ Transparent and auditable
- ✅ Horizon Catalog alignment
- ✅ Aligned with real-world enterprise Snowflake practices


> The decision to materialize Marketplace data into RAW tables is a **deliberate architectural choice**, 
  reflecting a deep understanding of Snowflake security, task execution semantics, and shared data limitations — not a workaround.
